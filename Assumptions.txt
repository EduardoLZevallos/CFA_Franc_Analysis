- will not remove outliers for cfa franc zone because each period only has 14 data points 
- some contention with what chatgpt considers positive negative indicators
- skipping analysis if data isn't recent 
- changed analysis to be only middle and western africa
- no log scale value for zero
- Comoros is in the cfa zone, but from eastern africa zone so not in this analysis
