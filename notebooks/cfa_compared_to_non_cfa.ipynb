    "# Introduction\n",
    "This analysis compares the median per year for various IMF metrics of CFA franc zone countries to non-CFA franc zone African countries in the Western and Middle Africa region. The purpose is to challenge the claim that the CFA franc zone promotes growth and development. It's important to note that this analysis does not suggest that the CFA franc is the sole cause of underdevelopment in these countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The countries in the [CFA Franc zone](https://abc-economie.banque-france.fr/sites/default/files/medias/documents/816153_fiche_zone-franc.pdf) for this analysis are: <br>\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The Non CFA countries for this analysis are the countries in the [West Africa and Middle Africa region](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methodology/m49/) not in the WAEMU or the CEMAC.\n",
    "\n",
    "### West Africa:\n",

    "\n",
    "Guinea-Bissau joined the WAEMU in 1997, Mali joined the WAUMU in 1984 and Equatorial Guinea joined the CEMAC in 1985, so any metrics before the year a country joined is considered Non-CFA and any metrics equal to or greater than the year a country joined the CFA is considered CFA.<br>\n",

    "I created all the graphs. The text below the graphs, labeled \"What is {indicator}\" and \"Conclusion,\" is generated by ChatGPT 3.5 using this [prompt](https://github.com/EduardoLZevallos/CFA_Franc_Analysis/blob/main/src/cfa_analysis/presentation.py#L159C3-L168). The purpose of the prompt is to provide a basic definition for each indicator and then draw a simple conclusion regarding economic development based on the count of times when the median for an indicator is greater. For instance, if from 1980 to 2022, Non-CFA countries had a higher median GDP 18 times out of the 22 years, the prompt would conclude that Non-CFA countries had relatively better economic development than CFA countries.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The graphs presented in the Analysis section support my challenge to the idea that the CFA franc zone is beneficial for economic growth and development. The graphs in the appendix are additional ones I created from the same IMF data source and prompt.<br> \n",

    "# CFA Franc Zone\n",
    "The CFA franc, originally the French African Colonial franc, was created in 1945 and imposed on France's colonies. The CFA franc zone of today is an area of monetary cooperation, comprised of two African economic zones: the West Africa Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) and the Central African Economic and Monetary Union (CEMAC), along with Comoros. It should be noted that since 1993, the two CFA francs and the Comorian franc cannot be exchanged for one another. To exchange one currency for the other, it must first be converted to euros. This additional step in conversion creates additional demand for euros, which consequently acts as a privileged intermediary in trade between the African countries. Overall, more than 162 million people use the two CFA francs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key decisions concerning the CFA franc zone are made in Paris. The central actor in this system is the French Treasury. All foreign exchange transactions (the purchase or sale of CFA francs) of the 15 countries in the franc zone must go through the French Treasury due to the French guarantee of unlimited convertibility of CFA francs into euros. This makes France the only country in the world that directly manages a set of currencies distinct from its own.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CFA franc zone is based on four interrelated principles: the fixed exchange rate, the free movement of capital, the free convertibility of the currency, and the centralization of foreign exchange reserves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Supporters of the CFA franc system suggest that it provides monetary stability, economic attractiveness, investment inflows, and an increase in the growth rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea that the CFA franc promotes growth and development has been widely touted by the Bank of France. In 2015, the Bank of France stated, \"For over forty years, the franc zone has been an instrument of solidarity and development aimed at consolidating growth, reducing poverty, and deepening regional integration.\" Additionally, in 2012, Christian Noyer, the governor of the Bank of France, remarked, \"The last fifty years have shown that the franc zone is a favorable factor for development.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the CFA franc zone has four major downsides for the countries that are part of it: an excessively rigid exchange rate regime, a problematic pegging to the euro, the underfinancing of African economies, and a free movement of capital that generates a massive financial bleed-out.<br> "
