- some contention with what chatgpt considers positive negative indicators
- Comoros is in the cfa zone, but from eastern africa zone so not in this analysis
- regions determed by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_regions_of_Africa  which is sourced from UN
- if less than 80% of data per imf query dont use the data see get_all_metric_data
- if the difference between count of intervals where CFA / Non cfa is less than or equal to 2 then its considered equal
