This analysis does not suggest that the CFA franc is the only cause of these countries’ underdevelopment.\nThe countries in the CFA Franc zone for this analysis are:  ### WAEMU - Benin - Burkina Faso - Côte d’Ivoire - Mali - Niger - Senegal - Togo - Guinea Bissau\n\nCEMAC\n\nCameroon\nCongo\nGabon\nEquatorial Guinea\nCentral African Republic\nChad  Source: https://abc-economie.banque-france.fr/sites/default/files/medias/documents/816153_fiche_zone-franc.pdf\n\nThe Non CFA countries for this analysis are the countries in the West Africa and Middle Africa zone not in the WAEMU or the CEMAC. The African regional zones used in this analysis are determined by the UN. (add citation)  ### West Africa: - Cabo Verde - The Gambia - Ghana - Guinea - Liberia - Mauritania - Sierra Leone - Nigeria\n\n\nMiddle Africa:\n\nSão Tomé and Príncipe\nAngola\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo\n\nGuinea-Bissau joined the WAEMU in 1997, Mali joined the WAUMU in 1984 and Equatorial Guinea joined the CEMAC in 1985, so any metrics before the year a country joined is considered Non-CFA and any metrics equal to or greater than the year a country joined the CFA is considered CFA. The Comoros is ommited from this analysis, it is part of the Comorian Franc."

Exports of Goods and Services for non cfa countries made up a larger percent of their GDP comparing to cfa countries supporting the authors claim that CFA countries are more import dependent. Net Foreign direct investment was also a much larger percent of non cfa countries, suggesting non cfa countries did a better job of attracting investment into the country."

If the difference in the count of times when the median was greater for CFA and NON-CFA is less than or equal to 2, then the difference isn’t considered significant and the two zomes are reported as having the same count of times when the medians were greater.\n\n\nCode\nimport traceback\nfrom typing import List, Optional\nimport logging\nfrom bokeh.io import output_notebook\nimport polars as pl\nfrom cfa_analysis.data_retrieval import (\n    get_country_mapping,\n    get_indicators_data,\n    get_all_duplicate_dfs,\n    get_imf_data_df,\n    get_cfa_and_noncfa_data,\n)\nfrom cfa_analysis.data_cleanup import (\n    find_outliers_IQR,\n    clean_up_indicators_dict,\n    find_duplicate_indicators,\n    merge_duplicate_dfs,\n)\nfrom cfa_analysis.analysis import process_single_indicator\nfrom cfa_analysis.data_classes import Indicator\nfrom cfa_analysis.constants import (\n    CFA_FRANC_ZONE,\n    WEST_AFRICA,\n    MIDDLE_AFRICA,\n    SKIP_INDICATORS,\n)\n\n%load_ext jupyter_ai_magics\noutput_notebook()\n%env OPENAI_API_KEY=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\n\n\n\n    \n        \n        Loading BokehJS ...\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nenv: OPENAI_API_KEY=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\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndef generate_metric_graphs(only_these_indicators: Optional[List[str]] = None) -&gt;

    "text": "What is the CFA Franc?\nThe CFA Franc (originally, franc des colonies françaises d’Afrique) is a common currency introduced by the French in 1945 for several Africa colonies. The CFA franc is issued in two currency blocks by separate central banks – Banque Centrale des États de l’Afrique de l’Ouest (BCEAO) and the Banque des États de l’Afrique Centrale (BEAC). The French can veto their decisions and monetary policy is set by the ECB. Overall, more than 162 million people use the two CFA francs. The coins and notes used daily by the Africans of the franc zone continue to be manufactured in the former metropole, and specifically in the department of Puy-de-Dôme, and in Pessac, in the department of Gironde. It is in Paris that all the major decisions concerning the CFA franc are taken. The central actor of this system is the French Treasury, which answers to the French Ministry of the Economy and Finance and de facto has the power to determine the external value of the CFA franc. Moreover, all the foreign exchange transactions (the purchase or sale of CFA francs) of the 15 countries of the franc zone have to go through the French Treasury. This makes France the only country in the world that directly manages, albeit opaquely, a set of currencies a priori distinct from its own.\nOverall, the banks and companies in question responded to the logic of the ‘colonial pact’,15 which was centred around four fundamental rules: the colonies were forbidden from industrialising, and had to content themselves with supplying raw materials to the metropole which transformed them into finished products that were then resold to the colonies; the metropole enjoyed the monopoly of colonial exports and imports; it also held a monopoly in the shipping of colonial products abroad; finally, the metropole granted commercial preferences to the products of the colonies.16 This ‘colonial pact’ established relationships of dependence that forced the colonies to constantly adapt to the economic conjuncture of the metropole and to the requirements of its economic development.\n’In matters of defence, these agreements guarantee the provision of bases whose global strategic importance does not need to be stressed. In economic terms, they guarantee preferential markets for our products. They allow us to pay in francs for purchases [from these countries].”34 In other words, France did not need foreign currency, such as dollars, to buy goods and services from the countries that used the CFA franc. Quote is from Secretary of State for Relations with the States of the Community, Jean Foyer. On 11 July 1960, to the senate\ngeneral functioning of the CFA system continues to be based on four interrelated principles: the fixed exchange rate, the free movement of capital, the free convertibility of the currency and the centralisation of the foreign exchange reserves. First principle that of the fixed exchange rate, the CFA and Comorian francs are firmly pegged to the French currency, called the ‘anchor currency’: that is to say that their value in French francs does not change depending on the economic situation. It can only be modified by the political authorities of the franc zone. The second principle is that of the free movement of capital. This means that current transactions (payment of imports and exports, repatriation of profits and dividends, remittances from expatriate workers, etc.) and capital movements (the purchase of securities or financial investments) are not subject to any currency restrictions within the franc zone, that is, between the African member states and between these and France.The free convertibility of the currency, the third operational principle of the franc zone, means that CFA and Comorian francs can be exchanged for the French currency (first the franc, now the euro) without restrictions. This unlimited convertibility is guaranteed by the French Treasury: through the monetary agreements it has entered into with the African authorities, it has undertaken to lend all the money necessary to the central banks of the franc zone in the eventuality that they should exhaust their reserves. The goal is to ensure that central banks never lack foreign currency and can always settle their foreign transactions or foreign exchange transactions on a daily basis, but also to ensure that the movement of capital is never subject to restrictions within the franc zone. should be noted that since 1993 the two CFA francs and the Comorian franc have not even been freely convertible among each other. The non-convertibility of the CFA banknotes creates an additional demand for euros, which therefore acts as a privileged intermediary in trade between the African countries. Finally, the fourth principle establishes the centralisation of the foreign exchange reserves: the BEAC, the BCEAO and the BCC must deposit a part of their foreign exchange reserves in France, at the French Treasury. Initially, this obligation concerned all their foreign exchange reserves with the exception of the liquidity required for daily operations, gold reserves and commitments made to the IMF. This percentage was reduced to 65 per cent in the early 1970s and to 50 per cent in 2005 for the BCEAO and in 2007 for the BEAC. Technically, the central banks have the opportunity to place the other half of their foreign exchange reserves elsewhere, even on accounts outside the euro area\nFrench representatives sit on the boards of the central banks as well as in their monetary policy committees, the bodies responsible for defining their monetary policy. This configuration has no equivalent in the world\nFrench newspaper La Croix dedicated almost an entire page, in its 17 February 1960 edition, to an assessment of the franc zone. ‘It has allowed France to obtain supplies of various raw materials (lead, zinc, manganese, nickel, wood, phosphates, oilseeds…) without the need to disburse any foreign currency’, the article explained. ’It is estimated that this has resulted in a saving of 250 million dollars a year\nargue for decades, the champions of the CFA system have insisted on the virtuous circle of this device: monetary stability, economic attractiveness, investment inflows, increase in the growth rate.\nsingle currency, the CFA franc implies various constraints: to begin with, the countries that use it don’t have the possibility of choosing a parity that is appropriate to their national economic situation. Furthermore, the limitation of domestic credit as a means of defending the fixed parity also has its negative side: the limitation of domestic financing for development. ‘The CFA franc has only a stabilising role and plays no active role in the economy’, noted the economist Makhtar Diouf in 2002.13 One of the consequences of this is that African countries must look abroad if they want to finance their development\nCFA system actually inflicts four major handicaps to the countries that are part of it: an excessively rigid exchange rate regime; a problematic pegging to the euro; the underfinancing of the African economies; and a free movement of capital that generates a massive financial bleed-out\nParis effectively takes all the important decisions regarding the CFA and Comorian francs, often without even informing the concerned states in advance. An example of this is the devaluation of the French franc in December 1958, on the eve of the independence process, and again in August 1969. These unilateral decisions forced the African countries to undertake a heavy adjustment in order to maintain the parity with the French franc, and had serious negative repercussions in the African countries, including an increase in the cost of living, especially in the cities, as well as in the value of their foreign debt. In 1994, a similar decision had even more dramatic consequences: against the opinion of the majority of African leaders, France decided to devalue the CFA francs by 50 per cent, thus altering their parity with the French franc for the first time in 46 years. The history of this event, which sent an unprecedented shockwave across the franc zone, shows how the French authorities are used to working. Devaluation leads to increase price of imports and increase in foreign debt. Currency lost vale so you need more of it to pay for the same thing.\nThere is another important point to note: the Bank of France holds almost 90 per cent of the gold reserves of the BCEAO, and therefore of the WAEMU countries, estimated in 2017 at 1,174.234 ounces, or nearly 36.5 tons.62\nIn 1970, the French Economic and Social Council listed in a report the ‘indisputable advantages for France’ deriving from the maintenance of the franc zone. It highlighted how the African countries of the franc zone were providing more and more reserves to France, part of which was used to regulate their trade deficit with the French economy. There was another positive aspect for the French state: ‘The overseas countries remain for French exports, if not “privileged markets”, at least large and stable markets.’ Finally, the CFA system ‘proved to be interesting because the free movement of capital provides a guarantee for French interests in Africa’ and allows France ’to purchase raw materials in French francs\nThe franc zone also continues to offer to French industries markets where they are in the position of being preferred suppliers. This is because the African states have not been able to industrialise their economies and therefore to transform their raw materials in such a way as to satisfy their domestic markets.\nthat its former colonies have often paid for their imports from France between 20 and 30 per cent more than world prices.23 Conversely, the prices paid by France and its companies for the products of the franc zone are often lower than world prices.\nAn exit from the CFA franc will be successful only if it is part of a larger project to regain all the tools of economic sovereignty: budgetary policy, industrial and commercial policy, control over capital flows and so on\n⁃ decades, the champions of the CFA system have insisted on the virtuous circle of this device: monetary stability, economic attractiveness, investment inflows, increase in the growth rate. ⁃ single currency, the CFA franc implies various constraints: to begin with, the countries that use it don’t have the possibility of choosing a parity that is appropriate to their national economic situation. Furthermore, the limitation of domestic credit as a means of defending the fixed parity also has its negative side: the limitation of domestic financing for development. ‘The CFA franc has only a stabilising role and plays no active role in the economy’, noted the economist Makhtar Diouf in 2002.13 One of the consequences of this is that African countries must look abroad if they want to finance their development\nObviously, the CFA franc is not the only cause of these countries’ underdevelopment and other African countries have not necessarily ‘fared better’. But the claim that the CFA franc has ‘promoted’ growth and development in the area is patently false.\n\nWAEMU\n\nBenin\nBurkina Faso\nCôte d’Ivoire\nMali\nNiger\nSenegal\nTogo\nGuinea Bissau\n\n\n\nCEMAC\n\nCameroon\nCongo\nGabon\nEquatorial Guinea\nCentral African Republic\nChad  Source: https://abc-economie.banque-france.fr/sites/default/files/medias/documents/816153_fiche_zone-franc.pdf\n\nGuinea-Bissau joined the WAEMU in 1997, Mali joined the WAUMU in 1984 and Equatorial Guinea joined the CEMAC in 1985, so any metrics before the year a country joined is considered Non-CFA and any metrics equal to or greater than the year a country joined the CFA is considered CFA. The Comoros is ommited from this analysis, it is part of the Comorian Franc."

Technically, the central banks have the opportunity to place the other half of their foreign exchange reserves elsewhere, even on accounts outside the euro area. MAKE SURE THIS IS TRUE This obligation of reserve requirements has ended due to the Macro-Ouattara Reform, instead of member countries storing 50% of their reserves in the French Treasury, ECOWAS states will now exercise control over their reserves. However the it includes the same French monetary guarantees as before. DONT UNDERSTAND THIS ““You should know that France will stand alongside the member states of the area if there is a crisis,” says Le Maire. “It’s just a guarantee, and a new stability guarantee that is brought in, but it’s a guarantee of last resort that will only be used, and only if, there is a financial crisis,” he adds.\nThe monetary guarantee means that CFA francs have an unlimited convertibility into euros. Inter-zone transfers will also be facilitated.”"

An example of this is the devaluation of the French franc in December 1958, on the eve of the independence process, and again in August 1969. These unilateral decisions forced the African countries to undertake a heavy adjustment in order to maintain the parity with the French franc, and had serious negative repercussions in the African countries, including an increase in the cost of living, especially in the cities, as well as in the value of their foreign debt. In 1994, a similar decision had even more dramatic consequences: against the opinion of the majority of African leaders, France decided to devalue the CFA francs by 50 per cent, thus altering their parity with the French franc for the first time in 46 years. The history of this event, which sent an unprecedented shockwave across the franc zone, shows how the French authorities are used to working. Devaluation leads to increase price of imports and increase in foreign debt. Currency lost vale so you need more of it to pay for the same thing.\nThere is another important point to note: the Bank of France holds almost 90 per cent of the gold reserves of the BCEAO, and therefore of the WAEMU countries, estimated in 2017 at 1,174.234 ounces, or nearly 36.5 tons.62\nIn 1970, the French Economic and Social Council listed in a report the ‘indisputable advantages for France’ deriving from the maintenance of the franc zone. It highlighted how the African countries of the franc zone were providing more and more reserves to France, part of which was used to regulate their trade deficit with the French economy. There was another positive aspect for the French state: ‘The overseas countries remain for French exports, if not “privileged markets”, at least large and stable markets.’ Finally, the CFA system ‘proved to be interesting because the free movement of capital provides a guarantee for French interests in Africa’ and allows France ’to purchase raw materials in French francs\nThe franc zone also continues to offer to French industries markets where they are in the position of being preferred suppliers. This is because the African states have not been able to industrialise their economies and therefore to transform their raw materials in such a way as to satisfy their domestic markets.\nthat its former colonies have often paid for their imports from France between 20 and 30 per cent more than world prices.23 Conversely, the prices paid by France and its companies for the products of the franc zone are often lower than world prices.\nAn exit from the CFA franc will be successful only if it is part of a larger project to regain all the tools of economic sovereignty: budgetary policy, industrial and commercial policy, control over capital flows and so on\n⁃ decades, the champions of the CFA system have insisted on the virtuous circle of this device: monetary stability, economic attractiveness, investment inflows, increase in the growth rate. ⁃ single currency, the CFA franc implies various constraints: to begin with, the countries that use it don’t have the possibility of choosing a parity that is appropriate to their national economic situation.

The Comoros is ommited from this analysis, it is part of the Comorian Franc."
