    "text": "Abstract\nThis analysis uses AI to compare the median per year for various IMF metrics of CFA franc zone countries to non-CFA franc zone African countries in the Western and Middle Africa region. The purpose of this analysis is to challenge the claim that the CFA franc zone promotes growth and development. It’s important to note that this analysis does not suggest that the CFA franc is the sole cause of underdevelopment in these countries."

    "section": "Background",
    "text": "Background\nThe CFA franc, originally the French African Colonial franc, was created in 1945 and imposed on France’s colonies. \nThe CFA franc zone of today is an area of monetary cooperation, composed of two African economic zones: the West Africa Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) and the Central African Economic and Monetary Union (CEMAC), along with Comoros.\nThe countries in the CFA franc zone for this analysis are: \n\nWAEMU\n\nBenin\nBurkina Faso\nCôte d’Ivoire\nMali\nNiger\nSenegal\nTogo\nGuinea Bissau\n\n\n\nCEMAC\n\nCameroon\nCongo\nGabon\nEquatorial Guinea\nCentral African Republic\nChad \n\nThe non-CFA franc zone countries for this analysis are the countries in the West Africa and Middle Africa region not in the WAEMU or the CEMAC. \n\n\nWest Africa:\n\nCabo Verde\nThe Gambia\nGhana\nGuinea\nLiberia\nMauritania\nSierra Leone\nNigeria\n\n\n\nMiddle Africa:\n\nSão Tomé and Príncipe\nAngola\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo\n\nGuinea-Bissau joined the WAEMU in 1997, Mali joined the WAEMU in 1984 and Equatorial Guinea joined the CEMAC in 1985, so any metrics before the year a country joined is considered non-CFA franc zone and any metrics equal to or greater than the year a country joined the CFA franc zone is considered CFA franc zone.\nThe Comoros is ommited from this analysis, it is part of the East Africa region and uses the Comorian Franc.\nOverall, more than 162 million people use the two CFA francs. The CFA franc zone is based on four interrelated principles:\n\nfixed exchange rate\nfree movement of capital\nfree convertibility of the currency\ncentralization of foreign exchange reserves\n\nKey decisions concerning the CFA franc zone are made in Paris. The central actor in this system is the French Treasury. All foreign exchange transactions (the purchase or sale of CFA francs) of the 15 countries in the franc zone must go through the French Treasury due to the French guarantee of unlimited convertibility of CFA francs into euros. This makes France the only country in the world that directly manages a set of currencies distinct from its own.\nSupporters of the CFA franc system suggest that it provides monetary stability, economic attractiveness, investment inflows, and an increase in the growth rate.\nThe idea that the CFA franc promotes growth and development has been widely touted by the Bank of France. In 2015, the Bank of France stated, “For over forty years, the franc zone has been an instrument of solidarity and development aimed at consolidating growth, reducing poverty, and deepening regional integration.” Additionally, in 2012, Christian Noyer, the governor of the Bank of France, remarked, “The last fifty years have shown that the franc zone is a favorable factor for development.”\nHowever, the CFA franc zone has four major downsides for the countries that are part of it:\n\nan excessively rigid exchange rate regime\na problematic pegging to the euro\nthe underfinancing of African economies\na free movement of capital that generates a massive financial bleed-out\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\nThe text below the graphs, labeled “Definition of {indicator}” and “Comparing Median Intervals for indicator {indicator},” is generated by ChatGPT 3.5 using this prompt. The purpose of the prompt is to provide a definition for each indicator and then draw a conclusion comparing the the CFA franc zone and non-CFA franc zone countries based on count in which the median was greater across the yearly intervals for the given indicator. For example, if non-CFA countries had a higher median GDP 18 times out of the 22 yearly intervals between 1980 and 2022, the prompt will draw a conclusion based on that count.\nThe graphs presented in the “Analysis” section support my challenge to the idea that the CFA franc zone is beneficial for economic growth and development. The graphs in the appendix are created from the same IMF data source with the same prompt.\n\n\nCode\nfrom IPython.display import clear_output\nfrom bokeh.io import output_notebook\nfrom cfa_analysis.main import generate_metric_graphs\n\n%load_ext jupyter_ai_magics\n%env OPENAI_API_KEY=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\nclear_output()\noutput_notebook()\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n        Loading BokehJS ..."
