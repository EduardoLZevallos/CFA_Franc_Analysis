PRIORITY:
- correct for when CFA countries joined economic union, requires correct analyze functions
- indicator on graph, telling user about negative numbers formatting
- fix issue where some chatgpt formatting doesn't respect the two sections
- see if we can flip the chart for negative numbers
- try chat gpt model

- make graph bigger?  
- how did I determine the african regions? 
- real long term government bond yield the chatgpt explanation is broken thinks both
- Direct Investment Abroad - chatgpt reading it as none
- to add zeros to the graph can use patch https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/issues/6536 


SECONDARY:
- consider percentiles, could do a box plot
- pre 2000 how much data do we actually have? 

ELSE: 
- graph the confidence intervals - MAKES NO SENSE - but break that out into another notebook and save it
- break out the cfa into the two economic unions?
- make question of the analysis more explicit
- save the results in structure, in case I want to make changes. 
- set up drone
- consider making the graph wider 
- review prompt from gpt4 about analyzing results - might want to graph confidence intervals https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71916767/how-to-plot-confidence-interval-of-a-time-series-data-in-python
