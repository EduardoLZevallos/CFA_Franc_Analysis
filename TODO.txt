PRIORITY:
- Fix test and add more test
- Select graphs that I want for analysis, and add other graphs to an appendix 
- pull out logic that checks if we have enough datapoints and work that into this analysis
- find a better way to store keys
- Go through notes from book and see what I want to include 
- Read prompt engineering doc from open ai https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering  
- indicator on graph, telling user about negative numbers formatting
- Create Readme make sure assumptions are included in there.
- fix issue where some chatgpt formatting doesn't respect the two sections
- to add zeros to the graph can use patch https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/issues/6536 

SECOND PRIORITY:
- consider percentiles, could do a box plot
- graph the confidence intervals - MAKES NO SENSE - but break that out into another notebook and save it
- set up drone
- review prompt from gpt4 about analyzing results - might want to graph confidence intervals https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71916767/how-to-plot-confidence-interval-of-a-time-series-data-in-python
